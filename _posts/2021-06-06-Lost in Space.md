This map serves to illustrate the complexity and difficulty of automating the geocoding process. Colonial nations share placenames, and based on the implicit bias of your chosen geo-coder many placenames default to either America or England. This triangle visualises only a small portion of duplicated placenames across Australia, England and America.
