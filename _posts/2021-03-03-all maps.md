<p style="text-align: center;">this is a visualisation of the names of homesteads mentioned in the bushfire collection. These homesteads use Indigenous language, these have been located through historical gazettes. This map shows the popularity of the names and why the author may have chosen to use them in their fiction, as they are dispersed across the country. There are many others that are imaginary.</p>
