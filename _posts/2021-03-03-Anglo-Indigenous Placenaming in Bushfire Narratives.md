This is a visualisation of the names of homesteads mentioned in the bushfire collection. Most of these homesteads use Indigenous language. The homesteads visualised on this map have been located through historical gazettes and the Survey of Australian Placenames. Rather than attempting to rectify these homesteads with their potential location in their respective chapters, I have chosen to visualise every itteration of historical homesteads that share the same name.

This map potentially shows the popularity and ubiquity of the use of Indigenous language in naming place, and potentially indicates why the authors may have chosen these names. For example, you will notice that a **Kooringa** appears in NSW, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia.
 
For the narratives coded as Narrative Foreground, the homestead seems to operate as the spatial totality of the entire chapter or story. References to Sydney or Melbourne (although recurrent) are often only locational.  This is not to say, however, that the geo-rectification of homesteads indicates any relationship with their real world referent. But, it does indicate the limitations of geo-location of placenames in particular genres of narrative. 

For example,  For example, "A Terrible Christmas Day: A True Story of the Olden Time" (1892) opens by setting the scene at **Burraga run**.  It is a historical story, dating back to 1833 and clearly a frontier tale.  **Burraga station** is described at the outset as “situated near the north-eastern border of the tableland of New England,” further, “it had only been redeemed from the wilderness some two or three years before the time of the commencement of this narrative.” Indeed there is a **Burraga station** in NSW, however, according to the Survey of Australian Place Names its actual geo-location is just beyond the Blue Mountains. Further consultation of historical gazettes held by the NLA do not reveal an alternative **Burraga run** near this location.

The point here is to ask what is the function of evoking these names? What does this add to the narrative, and then respectively, what does it mean for these places to then be defended from or destroyed by fire?

The following is a list of homesteads and stations that cannot be identified in The Survey of Australian Placenames. 
It is conceivable that these authors have simply constructed approximations of Indigenous sounding words, or have entirely de-contextualised language to the extent that it is difficult to locate the word in relation to any given language group.
